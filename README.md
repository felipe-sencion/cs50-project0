# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project is called Nile and it's an e-commerce platform simulation.

It consists of five pages:
  The landing page
  Electronics page
  Books page
  Home page
  Sports & Outdoors page

Landing page
Contains a bootstrap's grid component that reacts to the size of the browser and the grid contains links to the other pages.

Electronics page
Contains a responsive row component with links to the other pages. Below that component there is a responsive container with 10 products. Each product contains the name of an item, it's picture, the price, a spinbox and a button. The first product has a link to a page with a detailed description of the product. In that page there is a table and within that table there's an unordered list.

The rest of the pages are similar to the electronics page.

For the styling the project uses a single style.css file which was generated from a sass file called style.scss .
